      GOOD TO KNOW ABOUT THE COMMUNITY
    </h2>
    The community has played host to major events in Nigerian history but lacked the
    most important change agent that every developed, developing community, state,
    and countries use as a driving change for a better society and advancement
    which is Education. Until the 2nd of August 2019, the Idua Assang community
    has been without a high school/ secondary school when patriotic community youths
    came together with the support of the community Chiefs and Officials to set
    up a school the IDUA COMMUNITY HIGH SCHOOL ORON, which resumed learning on
    the 16th of September 2019. Presently the school has about one hundred and
    seventy students and keeps growing. This school has maintained steady growth
    but there's a lack and inaccessibility to study materials for the student who
    are from underprivileged homes, the nearest library that is accessible by the
    public is at the state capital (UYO) which is about an hour drive by road and
    seemingly not trackable hence, the need to set up a library to aid the students
    and encourage parents to take education as an important tool in shaping the
    life of their children.
